    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>I am from Jerome, Idaho. I have been married for almost 2 1/2 years. I am studying cyber security with a minor in CS. I am the oldest brother of three boys. </p>
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>I enjoy anything with computers. I use arch btw... In my free time, I do lots of ctf's on hackerone and hack the box. One of my projects I am most exited about is programming in C is a ps1 emulator. This will be ran on my raspberry pi and with an ESP32 I am programming a remote control to play games via a breadboard.</p>
