    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      I am from Jerome, Idaho. I have been married for almost 2 1/2 years. I am studying cyber security with a minor in CS. I am the oldest brother of three boys.
    </p>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
      I enjoy anything with computers. I use Arch btw... In my free time, I do lots of CTFs on HackerOne and Hack The Box. One of my projects I am most excited about is programming a PS1 emulator in C. This will run on my Raspberry Pi, and with an ESP32 I am programming a remote control to play games via a breadboard.
